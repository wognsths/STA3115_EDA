## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
billboard %>% separate(time, into = c("minutes", "seconds"), sep = ":") %>% .[, c("year", "artist.inverted", "track", "minutes", "seconds")]
```
```{r}
as.numeric(billboard$minutes)
billboard |> mutate(time_in_min = numeric(minutes) + numeric(seconds) / 60)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
